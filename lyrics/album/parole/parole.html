        [Verse 1] <br />
        Wasted times I spent with someone else <br />
        She wasn't even half of you <br />
        Reminiscin' how you felt <br />
        Reminiscin' how you felt <br />
        And even though you put my life through hell <br />
        I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you <br />
        I want you to myself <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        [Chorus] <br />
        And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now? <br />
        Who you give that love to now? <br />
        Who you pullin' up on? <br />
        Who you gettin' sprung for now? <br />
        And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot <br />
        Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot <br />
        'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway <br />
        I ain't got no business catchin' feelings <br /><br />
        <br />

        [Verse 2] <br />
        Catchin' feelings <br />
        These girls only want you when you're winnin' (Winnin') <br />
        But you've been with me from the beginnin' (Ooh, yeah, yeah) <br />
        And I know right now that we're not talkin' (Not talkin') <br />
        I hope you know this dick is still an option <br />
        'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah) <br />
        I took my time to learn the way your body functions <br />
        You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (Ride it, baby) <br />
        This sex will get you high without no other substance <br /><br /><br />

        [Chorus] <br />
        So who do you belong to now? (Who do you belong to now?) <br />
        Who you give that love to now? (Who you give that love to now?) <br />
        Who you pullin' up on? <br />
        Who you gettin' sprung for now? (Who you gettin' sprung for now?) <br />
        And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot (I got a lot)
        <br />
        Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot (Blowin' up
        their spot) <br />
        'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway <br />
        I ain't got no business catchin' feelings (Feelings) <br />
        <br /><br />

        [Bridge] <br />
        Catchin' feelings <br />
        I ain't got no business catchin' feelings <br />
        I ain't got no business catchin' feelings <br />
        Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee <br />
        Feelings <br />
        I ain't got no business catchin' feelings <br />
        I ain't got no business catchin' feelings <br />
        Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee <br /><br /><br />

        [Outro] <br />
        Wake up <br />
        I don't wanna wake up <br />
        I don't wanna wake up <br />
        If you ain't layin' next to me <br />
        I don't wanna wake up <br />
        I don't wanna wake up <br />
        I don't wanna wake up <br />
        If you ain't layin' next to me-e-e <br />
        On me, me, on me, oh, I <br />
        On me, on me, on me <br /><br /><br />
